I did not think that the Russian would be at such risk in my own establishment. I dare say, I now do.\"\n\n\"And you saw no one go up those stairs at ten on the clock, or slightly before?\"\n\nHis eyes hovered together near his nose. \"No, Miss Borden, I was on my nightly watch, being mindful of that Rivers boy and his shameless carryings on with the harlot Miss Jewett. They've been keeping company here for quite some time, and always in the same room. God's teeth, but I dare say Rivers was enraged when the Russian fellow came to town.\"\n\n\"Rivers? Why would he be upset about the Russian?\"\n\n\"Because he took his room, he did.\"\n\nLizzie leaned forward, quite drawn in by his statement. \"You are telling me that Room 209 is usually occupied by Frank Rivers and his Fancy Girl?\"\n\nThe mustaches bobbed with the face. \"Dare say, I do! And it was a mighty strange manner in which it transpired. I had the Russian fellow booked by order of the French Count into a right proper room, one that hadn't been darkened in spirit by these nattering sons of nabobs. I had him in the Commonwealth Suite and was prepared to dandy him up with all sorts of linens and soaps, but at the last minute a messenger boy comes from the Commons House. Seems like there was a mix-up, a right proper one, and personages unknown have insisted that the Russian be lodged into 209. Who was I to question it? I thought to myself, I did. The letter came decorated with all of these city seals. I don't know this fellow's business, but if a French Count is involved and orders come from the Commons House, then who am I, Darius Wilbur, who possess nothing but an humble Ordinary of quality and stupefying face brushes, to question the properly embossed seals and signatures?\"\n\n\"Do you have the letter?\" Lizzie asked anxiously.\n\nKing Darius poked his face about under the desk, pulling up some boxes and peering into some sliding drawers. \"God's wounds but I know it's here somewhere.\" His eyes brightened and he brought up a folded paper. After snapping it open, he handed it to Lizzie, who took one quick glance at it, then handed it dismissively back.\n\n\"It's a forgery,\" she observed. \"It's not from the Commons House. Look at it closely: tan, mere butcher paper. And the signature says Larson E. Whipsnade. Who do you know in this city with the name Whipsnade.\"\n\nKing Darius's mustaches were trembling as if they had their own nervous system. \"I feel the fool, I do. Like if God has a fool all His own, it would be me.\"\n\nAndre took the paper from Lizzie and let out with a small chuckle. \"Tchakorov was being set up for thievery. They needed him in that room.\"\n\nLizzie peered up at the ceiling, measuring with her eyes. \"Mr. Wilbur,\" she asked, stepping back to get a cleaner view of the expansive molding. \"Would you say that Room 209 is just about . . . .there! Right near that fancy plaster cornucopia coming forth from the ceiling above?\"\n\n\"Sounds about right.\"\n\n\"And how many feet would you say between that cornucopia and the fancy swirls by the southern face?\"\n\n\"Looks to be about two or three feet, no more or less. But I can't reckon without climbing up there with a mason's rule.\"\n\n\"Is there another room between 209 and the southern face?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of, but I do believe there's crawl spaces all over the building. That's where the Weirds reside.\"\n\n\"The Weirds?\" Andre asked, puzzled.\n\n\"Ah, pay no attention to my fired imagination. It's a folly of my besotted brain. Too much mustache wax, I presume. But there are strange noises a'nights, especially since the Russian fellow's been pinched. From my post, I hear the thumping and the cursing.\"\n\n\"Cursing?\"\n\n\"More like the wailing of a lost spirit. I can't bring myself to go searching the corridors. Perhaps the night watch Fred would be able to tell you. Perhaps it's some suicide from long ago who's up there wandering to find his closure.\"\n\n\"Not being a spiritualist,\" Lizzie announced, \"I would sooner think it was just an intruder walking about.\"\n\n\"But the guests are all accounted for, they are!\" Darius said. \"Believe you me!\"\n\nAndre produced a small calling card that had a light trace of perfume. \"King Darius, you have given us valuable information.\"\n\n\"Right so,\" the bewhiskered manager beamed. \"When you decipher any of its meaning, let me know what it was that I did tell you, for I'll be danged if it makes sense to me right now.\"\n\n\"We will. And if anything of interest comes up, here is my card.\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nWhat clues in the text suggest that Mr. Nikolai Tchakorov was murdered?",
         "The reference text suggests that Mr. Nikolai Tchakorov was murdered based on the following clues:\n\n1. Mr. Tchakorov was found dead in Room 209 of the Yankee Pedlar Inn.\n\n2. Room 209 is located near a fancy plaster cornucopia coming forth from the ceiling above.\n\n3. Mr. Tchakorov's body was found with multiple axe wounds.\n\n4. The hotel manager, King Darius, suspects that Room 209 was the intended target of the murderer.\n\n5. The hotel's night watchman, Fred, has heard strange noises coming from the area near Room 209.\n\n6. A mysterious calling card with a light trace of perfume was found near Mr. Tchakorov's body.\n\n7. Mr. Tchakorov's business associates, Andre and Lizzie, believe that he was the victim of a setup.\n\n8. The hotel manager suspects that there may be hidden crawl spaces in the hotel where \"the Weirds\" reside.\n\nBased on these clues, it is suggested that Mr. Tchakorov was murdered in Room 209 of the Yankee Pedlar Inn and that the killer may have intended to target the room. The presence of multiple axe wounds and the mysterious calling card suggest that the murder was planned and may have been motivated by revenge or business-related issues.",

He posted a GIF of a flying bowl of petunias captioned, “Oh no, not again” (a reference to “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”).\n\nThis isn’t San Francisco Will Smith’s first rodeo in getting confused with the actor who shares his name. Indeed, his personal website is notthatwillsmith.com, and his Twitter bio also points out that he is “notthatwillsmith.”\n\nThe years long case of mistaken identity reached a crescendo Sunday, after the actor Will Smith strode onto the Oscars stage on live TV and smacked Rock, who had made a joke at the expense of Jada Pinkett Smith. After being flooded with Twitter comments after The Slap, @willsmith posted this: “Real talk, I’m not the person you’re upset/happy with. I make podcasts and video games for a living. At the risk of making people pissed off at me instead of that other guy, the world would be a better place if we stopped answering words with violence.”\n\nEven on the thread Friday in which gamer-podcaster Will Smith reiterated that he is not that Will Smith, Twitter users continued to mistakenly @ him. “Give back your Oscar CLOWN,” someone wrote in reply to @willsmith’s flying-petunias GIF.\n\nSympathizing with San Francisco Will Smith’s plight, one observer commented, “Somehow, still this many people are not questioning why the other guy would have a picture of some bearded white dude as their avatar?”\n\nMeanwhile, not helping matters was a tweet Sunday night by ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith — no relation to either of the Will Smiths — chastising the actor for his behavior, in which he tagged @willsmith.\n\n“Didn’t know until just this moment about @jadapsmith having Alopecia. She’s wonderful and great. So is @willsmith — which we all know,” Stephen A. Smith tweeted. “They’re both phenomenal. But you do NOT do what Will did in that setting.

By 2064, people aged 65 will be able to look forward to a further 25 years of life on average compared to around 20 now.\n\nBut health inequalities are likely to persist. At the moment there is a difference of around eight years in life expectancy between the most and least deprived areas, and the report warns that \"there is no clear trend of these differences reducing in the future.\"\n\nRead More\n\nThe number of smokers is likely to continue falling while the obesity levels are forecast to increase sliightly.\n\nThe report does not make predictions for other conditions, but it does suggest that with a growing number of elderly people levels of dementia will increase.\n\nHousing\n\nThe number of households will grow faster than the population between now and 2039. But more people will be living alone, with most of the growth expected to come in one person households.\n\nThe number of households will grow fastest in the cities, with 32% more in Cardiff by 2024 (compared to 2014) and 17% more in Swansea and Newport.\n\nBy contrast Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen, Neath Port Talbot, Monmouthshire, Conwy and Isle of Anglesey will all see growth of less 5% or less.\n\nThe increasing vulnerability of low lying areas to flooding will mean less land available for house building, at a time when the growing number of smaller households means more homes are required.\n\nEconomy\n\n(Photo: PA)\n\nReal income per head is predicted to double by 2050. The number of people working in highly skilled professional occupations and managerial roles is expected to grow, along with caring, leisure and other services.\n\nBy contrast there is likely to be a continuing fall in the numbers working in manufacturing and unskilled occupations.

I can't take care of you twenty-four hours a day; that is the only reason I am going to marry her!\"\n\n\"I don't need another mother!\"\n\n\"Don't worry, darling. I will always love you, and your mother, more than her,\" says Father as he hugs Cinderella.\n\nThen suddenly, a shadow gasps from the corner.\n\n\"Who's there?\" shouts Father. He looks behind him, but the person is gone. \"Don't worry, it doesn't matter,\" he says. \"I am going to marry her, so please don't be disrespectful again. Just remember, I love you and your mother more than anyone.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll try and be polite.\"\n\nThe wedding begins right as Cinderella's father enters.\n\n\"Will you take this man as your husband?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the stepmother replies, sounding unsure.\n\n\"Will you take this woman as your wife?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replies, looking a bit dull.\n###\n\nFrom the text, extract details on the emotions of Cinderella and her father at the wedding.

The episodes would have a seasonal pattern. The seasonal pattern worsening of mood that's typically more than the non-seasonal mood,\" Tufal said.\n\nBecause depression can be fatal, a Mercy Health spokesperson says they're committed to combating and treating behavioral disorders. There are now behavioral health specialists in primary care doctors offices. If a doctor sees signs of depression, patients can be treated right away.\n\n\"They're now embedded in with our practices, they can consult with the physician who the patient is already comfortable with, and they can have all of their needs met both health, mind, body and spirit,\" said Erica Blake, a Mercy Health spokesperson.\n\n\"Before they have a full blown major depressive episode we adjust their medications or we will prescribe light therapy or we would engage them and recommend you go out a lot and exercise and those types of things,\" said Tufal.\n\nAgain, doctors urge one of the best things people can do during the winter months to lift your mood is to exercise because you'll release some of the happy hormones.\n\nState representatives are beginning the process of making adjustments to Ohio Gov.

         "The reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nI have often wondered about how to provide a healthy balance of motivation, reward, and boundaries as a parent. This blog has helpful information. \nParenting is one of the hardest jobs out there. You’re responsible not just for feeding and clothing your children but raising and nurturing them into good human beings.\nHaving said that, there’s no fixed set of guidelines or one right way to parenting. Every child is different, and every parent is different, and therefore, good parenting can be different for everyone.\nOne aspect that is a must for good parenting is rewarding children.\nThe Importance of Rewarding Kids\nRewarding children for certain behaviors and rewarding hard work is extremely crucial to encourage them to continue doing it. Continuously rewarding kids for good actions will motivate them to repeat them until it becomes a habit. This is especially important when kids are younger.\nThe first seven years of a child’s life are quite important as during this time, their brains are rapidly growing, and they’re developing vital life and social skills.\nIf a parent can teach good habits to their children from a young age through a proper reward system, they have a good chance of sticking with them throughout their lives.\nAdditionally, rewarding kids, for example, by praising a child, makes them feel good about themselves. Consequently, it helps shape their personality as they have good self-esteem and self-confidence.\nSimilarly, there are a lot of benefits of rewarding children. It creates a positive atmosphere. Sometimes, it can even help discourage bad behavior.\nI’ve often thought how powerful our words are when we talk to our kids. Choosing empowering words seems like a good strategy to me. \nHow to Reward Kids\nSome parents might think that getting their children their favorite toy or the latest gadget is the way to reward them. That is not necessarily true. Giving your child a gift is an example of a tangible reward. You can reward your children through intangible gifts, such as praise.\nParents must give both tangible and intangible rewards to not make them too materialistic. A simple pat on the back or praising their actions is enough to make your child feel good and motivated to do it again.\nRewarding kids doesn’t always have to be done after they’ve accomplished something. It’s important to reward them simply for putting in their best effort too, regardless of whether they were able to achieve their goal or not.\nDangers of Rewarding Children\nDespite what many may believe, there is such a thing as too rewarding. The main goal of rewarding kids is to encourage a particular behavior or habit.\nIf you put too much focus on rewarding, your child might become only focused on the rewards and not on inculcating those habits. Even if it’s intangible rewards like praise, too much of it can turn your child into a narcissist.\nFor parents, even the smallest of good deeds and tiniest achievements by their children can make them incredibly happy and proud.\nFrom learning to tie their own shoelaces and getting potty trained to graduating from college and getting that first job, achieving these milestones simply fills parents with pride. However, to actually get their children to achieve those milestones, parents need to reward their kids regularly.\n\nWhat are positive and negative examples of rewards from the article? List some examples of how to reward kids. Take the quotes and information directly from the text without paraphrasing. I want to help supplement my style of parenting.",

         "Reference:\nTwo days after a naked man stood on the high altar of St. Peter’s Basilica in a shocking security breach, the basilica’s archpriest on Saturday held a penitential rite as required by canon law in cases where sacred places are desecrated.\n\nVatican News reported that the unidentified man was a Polish national who approached the high altar on June 1 as the basilica was about to close. He quickly undressed and climbed onto the altar. Photos posted online showed the words “Save children of Ukraine” written in marker on his back.\n\n“As officers of the Vatican Gendarmerie approached, the man did not resist but cooperated as they led him to the police station inside the Vatican,” the Vatican News report said. “After ascertaining his identity, the man was handed over to the Italian police, according to the Italy-Holy See Treaty, and was issued an expulsion order and instructed to leave Italian territory.”\n\nThe basilica’s main altar, where the pope celebrates Mass, is called the Altar of the Confession. Reached by climbing seven steps, the marble altar is located directly above St. Peter’s Tomb and is crowned by Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s large Baroque sculpted bronze canopy.\n\nCardinal Mauro Gambetti, the basilica’s archpriest, led the penitential rite, held at noon Rome time Saturday. Canons of the Chapter of the Papal Basilica of St. Peter’s and several members of the faithful also participated, Vatican News reported.\n\nAccording to a report by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner, during the act of reparation, the cardinal pointed out that “it is the structure of sin that conditions the hearts and minds of people.”\n\n“This structure of sin is the one that feeds the wars, the one that inhabits our society,” he added.\n\nReferring to the desecration carried out on June 1, the cardinal pointed out that it is this “structure of sin” that pushed the man “to make an inappropriate and deplorable gesture,” ACI Prensa reported.\n\n“We are here to tell the Lord that we recognize that this structure of sin conditions the actions of God’s people. Lord, we ask your forgiveness, purify us,” Gambetti said.\n\nNext, after praying the Creed, the cardinal blessed the water and later spread it on the altar as a sign of purification. Later, two nuns dressed the altar with a tablecloth, candles, flowers, and a crucifix.\n\nThe Code of Canon Law and the Ceremonial of Bishops provide guidance for situations where altars or other sacred spaces are violated.\n\nCanon No. 1211 states: “Sacred places are violated by gravely injurious actions done in them with scandal to the faithful, actions which, in the judgment of the local ordinary, are so grave and contrary to the holiness of the place that it is not permitted to carry on worship in them until the damage is repaired by a penitential rite according to the norm of the liturgical books.”\n\nThe Ceremonial of Bishops, Nos. 1070–1092, specifies that crimes that can desecrate a church are those that “do grave dishonor to sacred mysteries, especially to the eucharistic species, and are committed to show contempt for the Church, or are crimes that are serious offenses against the dignity of the person and society.”\n\nA penitential rite, either a Mass or a Liturgy of the Word, should be carried out as soon as possible after such a desecration, the norms state.\n\nInstruction:\nSelect the actions mentioned in the passage relating to the desecration at St. Peter's Basilica: \n- The naked man stood on the high altar of St. Peter's Basilica. \n- The man cooperated with the Vatican Gendarmerie and was taken to the police station. \n- Cardinal Mauro Angelino led the penitential rite at St. Peter's Basilica. \n- Water was blessed and spread on the altar as a sign of purification. \n- Two priests dressed the altar with a tablecloth, candles, flowers, and a crucifix.\nAdditionally, in less than 100 words explain what happened after the Vatican Gendarmerie took the man to the police station.",

         "Reference:\nFormer President Donald Trump has privately grumbled about Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds recently, with the ex-commander-in-chief holding the belief that she should endorse his 2024 presidential bid after he backed her successful 2018 gubernatorial candidacy, according to The New York Times.\n\nReynolds — who is in high demand amongst Republican presidential candidates and has committed to remaining neutral throughout the primary process — has had several prominent appearances with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who remains Trump's top rival for the GOP nomination.\n\nSome of the former president's advisors have mocked Reynolds' affirmation of neutrality, with a feeling in his political orbit that Reynolds is putting forth her best efforts to aid DeSantis without officially making her intentions known, according to the Times.\n\n\"She is quote-unquote neutral,\" an individual with close ties to Trump told the Times.\n\nAccording to the Times, Trump believes that Reynolds — whom he held a rally for in 2018 before she narrowly won her first full gubernatorial term that year — should have repaid him for his past support of her campaigns. The newspaper also reported that Trump has expressed similar sentiments about other Republicans whom he has previously endorsed.\n\n\"I hate to say it, without me, you know, she was not going to win, you know that, right?\" Trump said of Reynolds' 2018 campaign at a June rally in Iowa.\n\nHis statement — said in front of a group that overwhelmingly backs the governor — didn't elicit much of a reaction from the attendees, according to the Times.\n\nThe report also stated that Reynolds was incredulous that Trump felt that her initial election to the governorship was driven by his support of her campaign. The former president also backed Reynolds' 2022 reelection bid, which she won in a landslide.\n\nReynolds ascended to the Governor's office in May 2017 after Trump tapped then-Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad to become his ambassador to China.\n\nWhile Trump left the White House in 2021, Reynolds and DeSantis have become stars within the party, with many Republicans pointing to the coronavirus restrictions that the two governors fought against after the initial outbreak in 2020 as a significant reason for their success.\n\nThe Times noted that Reynolds and DeSantis are at ease with each other when they share appearances in front of GOP crowds, having formed a strong friendship as conservative leaders throughout the pandemic.\n\nInstruction:\nYou are a political commentator gathering information about the next presidential election. Does Donald Trump believe that Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds should endorse his 2024 presidential bid because he helped her during her campaign for governor?

         "according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nYou’ve banked vacation days and are ready to get out of the house. Now all you need is a destination. That’s why we’ve curated four action-packed trips across Southern Appalachia that will fill your summer with rides, rambles, rapids, and rocks. So pack your bags and crank up the car—it’s time to hit the road. \n\nIt’s not hard to find legendary singletrack in Brevard, N.C., a sleepy-eyed mountain town located at the entrance of Pisgah National Forest. What’s hard is deciding which trails to ride during your time in this mountain biking mecca. Luckily, Lucas Gomez—a mechanic at The Hub and Pisgah Tavern, a local bike shop and taproom—has perfected what he refers to as the “Ultimate Loop.”   \n\nClocking in at 41.4 miles with 5,394 feet of elevation gain, the route is “pretty stout,” Gomez warns. But for all your toiling, you’ll be rewarded with a taste of Pisgah’s most iconic trails, including Black Mountain, Bennett Gap, and Joel Branch. Riders will even get to sample Stony Knob, a “mystery flow trail in the middle of the woods that seems out of place but is a blast to come down,” says Gomez.\n\nFrom there, Gomez’s loop will spit you out in downtown Brevard, where you can recover with a white cheddar jalapeño pimento cheese sandwich from Rocky’s Grill and Soda Shop. For good measure, Gomez suggests you also add a chocolate shake to your order. “It’s probably not the best for your stomach, but it’s good for the soul,” he laughs. \n\nAfter refueling, follow the Brevard Bike Path back to your car and go rent a cabin at Pilot Cove. Situated within pedaling distance of Pisgah, this forest resort caters to mountain biking enthusiasts. There’s even an on-site flow track, just in case 41.4 miles didn’t tucker you out. \n\nIf you’re a newbie climber, it’s easy to feel intimidated by the 900-foot Tuscarora sandstone escarpment that is West Virginia’s Seneca Rocks. Fortunately, Tom Cecil is here to teach you the ropes. \n\nAs the owner of Seneca Rocks Mountain Guides (SRMG), Cecil leads monthly Kinship of the Rope Road Trips to this beloved landmark. Part climbing course, part meetup, these two-day rendezvous are designed to help beginner rock jocks build community while developing the confidence needed to climb outside of a gym.  \n\n“On the morning of day one, we assess your skills and start with something easy. We want everyone to feel comfortable,” Cecil explains. “Afterward, we head off to the summit of Seneca Rocks.”\n\nOn day two, guides take the group to Nelson Rocks, a striking rock formation located 10 miles south. “We’re the only ones allowed to climb there, so it’s a really cool, crowd-free experience,” says Cecil. \n\nIn the evenings, participants can crash at the SRMG Basecamp, a private campground situated on the banks of Seneca Creek. The outfitter also provides breakfast and dinner by the fire. But if you’re craving more formal fare, Cecil recommends making the 30-minute drive to The Hermitage Inn and Taphouse in Petersburg. Nestled in a nearly 200-year-old mansion, this eatery boasts stick-to-your-ribs comfort foods like smoked trout dip, cinnamon-spiced bread dredged in apple butter, and pulled pork nachos.   \n\nStretching roughly 290 miles from Springer Mountain, Ga., to Davenport Gap in the northeastern corner of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Benton MacKaye Trail (BMT) is a bit long for a weekend backpacking trip. But there are plenty of opportunities to section-hike this footpath, so long as you don’t mind being alone.   \n\n“This trail doesn’t see much traffic—I think I saw two backpackers during my time,” says Tara Dower, a thru-hiker and ultra-runner who polished off the BMT last summer. “So, it can be overgrown in areas but the peaceful seclusion makes for a wonderful experience.”\n\nIf you’re craving a few quiet days in the woods, travel six miles down Lakeview Drive near Bryson City, N.C. Also known as the Road to Nowhere, this scenic mountain highway was constructed to provide Swain County families displaced by the construction of Fontana Lake access to ancestral lands. But when environmental concerns cropped up in 1971, construction came to a screeching halt and never resumed. \n\nAlas, the highway now abruptly ends at a quarter-mile-long tunnel. When you arrive at this eerily dark shaft, every particle of your being will scream “Let’s just go home and doomscroll!” Ignore that little voice and enter anyway. You’ll then follow the BMT south for 34.7 miles to the Fontana Dam. \n\nAccording to Dower, this stretch of the trail can be pretty wiley. “Even though the elevation profile isn’t crazy, there are a lot of blowdowns,” she says. “It’s tough.” \n\nWhen you finish your trek—which should take between three to four days—treat yourself to a “dam burger” at Wildwood Grill. Afterward, you can either snuggle into a warm, cozy bed at Fontana Village Resort and Marina or rent a camp spot along the Little Tennessee River. \n\nIn 1972, when Warner Bros. finished filming the American thriller Deliverance in northeastern Georgia, local whitewater fanatic Claude Terry purchased used rafting equipment from the set and founded Southeastern Expeditions. The outdoor outfitter has been guiding trips down the Chattooga River ever since, says current owner Dusty Rogers. \n\n“We’re now the oldest rafting and kayaking company in the Eastern United States,” Rogers confirms.\n\nFor a taste of the feral Chattooga, book the company’s Wilder: Section IV tour. Starting at the Highway 76 bridge in Clayton, Ga., and ending at Lake Tugaloo, this seven-hour trip takes paddlers on a heart-pumping ride through famous, class IV rapids with foreboding names like “Corkscrew” and “Sock-em Dog.”\n\nIf you’re craving a more family-friendly excursion, Rogers recommends the Wild: Section III tour. This route commences at Thrifts Ferry Campground in Mountain Rest, S.C., and winds down to the Highway 76 bridge. Though generally tame, you can still expect stretches of top-notch whitewater.   \n\nPeople sit at tables with purple, red, and yellow umbrellas are places outside a restaurant\nthe Universal Joint in Clayton, Ga. Photo by Geoff Johnson/courtesy of Explore Georgia\nAfterward, change into some dry clothes and head to the Universal Joint for brisket tacos and loaded fries. For dessert, polish off a dozen (or two) donuts from The Farmhouse on North Main Street and then get comfy at The White Birch Inn, a quaint hotel nestled in the heart of historic Clayton.\n###\nOn a scale of 1 to 10,  with 1 being the least difficult, 5 being moderately difficult, and 10 being the most difficult, rate the level of difficulty for the following outdoor activities from the passage: hiking, rock climbing, whitewater rafting, and mountain biking.

         "Difficulty rating of the activities from the passage, arranged in order:\n\n1. Mountain biking\n2. Rock climbing\n3. Whitewater rafting\n4. Hiking\n\nThis is based on the level of skill and physical endurance required for each activity. Mountain biking is considered the most difficult due to the high level of physical endurance required and the technical skills needed to navigate the trails. Rock climbing is considered the second most difficult due to the technical skills required to climb the rocks and the physical endurance needed to climb for extended periods. Whitewater rafting is considered moderately difficult due to the physical endurance required and the need for good teamwork and decision-making skills. Hiking is considered the least difficult of the activities, but it still requires a good level of physical endurance and the ability to navigate the terrain.",

         "Reference:\nIt was the week of asking. Asking to watch her eat. Asking if she understood the doctors questions. Asking her to explain the difference between wanting to die right now, and dying later. The tumor making certain answers unquestionable. I watched her point to the incense dish from which someone swept all the ashes up. Asking if she recognized us. Because that is what the living want: thinking it is a sign we have been loved. But the answer was a summer drive, a mountain, piles of leaves beneath which a wolf slept, suckling her cubs. Some deaths are good and it makes them hard to grieve. She was, at times, in great pain. We wanted her to die, too. That was important. But first we wanted her to remember. From the bed, a finger pressed into a pile of leaves. Gray haunch, unmovable ashes. I didnt want to disturb their tableau, she told us. And drifted off. And we did not know the meaning behind this. The wolves must have looked so comfortable to her: wordless and in this wordlessness perfect. Did she want to go there, too. I could point to the image and say, my father must be in there, my uncle. Or: the wolf is you, you are still the mother, as if necessary to name that self at the end of its world. An animal cry, memory. That was our selfishness. As death was hers. She insisted upon it. And why not. It was good for me to get a chance to know you, she said, who had known me my entire life. Then the pills, a small handful, crushed into juice. She was happy then. We all were. Or said we were. What is the difference now.\n\nInstruction:\nWhat is the role of grief and embodiment in the poem?",
         "The poem explores the role of grief and embodiment in the speaker's relationship with their mother, who is dying of a brain tumor. The speaker describes the various ways in which the tumor affects their mother's ability to communicate and remember, and how this affects their relationship.\n\nThe poem highlights the embodied nature of grief, as the speaker experiences a range of emotions and sensations related to their mother's illness and impending death. The speaker describes their own desire to watch their mother eat, to ask her questions, and to see signs that she recognizes them. At the same time, they also acknowledge their own selfishness in wanting their mother to remember, as the tumor causes her to forget.\n\nThe poem also explores the role of embodiment in the experience of grief, as the speaker reflects on the physicality of their mother's illness and the ways in which her body is changing. The speaker describes their mother's happiness when she takes pills that relieve her pain, and how this brings a sense of peace to everyone in the room.\n\nOverall, the poem suggests that the experience of grief is intimately tied to the embodied nature of our relationships with others, and that the physical aspects of illness and death can be just as significant as the emotional ones.",

         "Refer to the information below to help with the following  delimited in ###:\n###\nTrans is the twelfth studio album by Canadian musician and singer-songwriter Neil Young, released on December 29, 1982. Recorded and released during his Geffen era in the 1980s, its electronic sound baffled many fans upon its initial release—a Sennheiser vocoder VSM201 features prominently in six of the nine tracks.\n\nBackground\nIn 1982, Young left Reprise Records, his record label since his debut album in 1968, to sign with Geffen Records—the label founded and owned by David Geffen, who had worked with Young as manager of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. Young's contract guaranteed him $1 million per album, as well as total creative control over his output.\n\nFrom late 1980 to mid-1982, Young spent much of his waking hours carrying out a therapy program for his young son, Ben, who was born with cerebral palsy and unable to speak. Neil disclosed to almost no one at the time that he was doing so, or that the repetitive nature of the songs on both the previous album, Re·ac·tor, and this one related to the exercises he was performing with Ben. Work on Trans began in late 1981 as a continuation of Re·ac·tor, with the usual Crazy Horse lineup. But then Young started playing with two new machines he had acquired, a Synclavier and a vocoder. Crazy Horse guitarist Poncho Sampedro recalled, \"Next thing we knew, Neil stripped all our music off, overdubbed all this stuff, the vocoder, weird sequencing, and put the synth shit on it.\"\n\nYoung's direction was influenced by the electronic experiments of the German band Kraftwerk, but more importantly he felt that distorting his voice reflected his attempts to communicate with his son. \"At that time he was simply trying to find a way to talk, to communicate with other people. That's what Trans is all about. And that's why, on that record, you know I'm saying something but you can't understand what it is. Well, that's exactly the same feeling I was getting from my son.\"\n\nYoung's first work for Geffen was a group of songs for an entirely different project, Island in the Sun, recorded in May 1982 in Hawaii. According to Young, it was \"a tropical thing all about sailing, ancient civilisations, islands and water.\" Young recalled later, \"Geffen thought it was okay, but he didn't think it was good enough.\"\n\nInstead of recording more new material, Young went back to the synthesizer tracks, actually recorded in the last days of the Reprise contract, and put together an album of songs from the two very different projects, three from Island in the Sun and six of the synthesizer tracks. Young proposed making a video to go with the album that would have clarified what the album was about. \"All of the electronic-voice people were working in a hospital, and the one thing they were trying to do is teach this little baby to push a button.\"\n\nAfter a year of work, the album was mixed in a hurry because Young was eager to go out on tour (documented in the home video Neil Young in Berlin), and a last-minute change in the running order is evident in the inclusion of a song called \"If You Got Love\" in the track listing and lyric sheet, even though it is not on the album. Portions of several tracks appeared in Young's 1982 feature-length comedy film Human Highway. Trans, along with Young's next Geffen release Everybody's Rockin', formed the basis of a 1983 lawsuit filed against Young by Geffen on the grounds that he had produced deliberately uncommercial and unrepresentative work. Young responded with a countersuit. Both suits were dropped within a matter of months, and David Geffen wound up personally apologizing to Young.\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Neil Young.\n\nSide one\n \"Little Thing Called Love\" – 3:13\n \"Computer Age\" – 5:24\n \"We R in Control\" – 3:31\n \"Transformer Man\" – 3:23\n \"Computer Cowboy (AKA Syscrusher)\" – 4:13\n\nSide two\n \"Hold On to Your Love\" – 3:28\n \"Sample and Hold\" – 5:09 (8:03 on CD versions)\n \"Mr. Soul\" – 3:19\n \"Like an Inca\" – 8:08 (9:46 on CD versions)\n\nPersonnel\nNeil Young – vocals, vocoder, guitars, bass, Synclavier, electric piano\nNils Lofgren – guitars, piano, organ, electric piano, Synclavier, backing vocals, vocoder\nBen Keith – pedal steel guitar, slide guitar, backing vocals\nFrank Sampedro – guitars, synthesizer\nBruce Palmer, Billy Talbot – bass\nRalph Molina – drums, backing vocals\nJoe Lala – percussion, backing vocals\n###\n\nWhat is the significance of the title Trans and how does it relate to the themes and ideas explored on the album?",
         "Neil Young's album Trans is a significant work in his musical career and is known for its innovative use of technology, particularly the vocoder. The title Trans is a play on the word \"transistor\" and refers to the electronic nature of the album. The album's songs explore the theme of communication, both literal and figurative, and the challenges that can arise when trying to connect with others.\n\nNeil Young was inspired to create Trans after spending much of his waking hours carrying out a therapy program for his son Ben, who was born with cerebral palsy and unable to speak. The album's songs reflect Young's attempts to find a way to communicate with his son, and the title Trans can be seen as a metaphor for this process. In the album's lyrics, Young uses distorted and manipulated vocals to express the feeling of being unable to understand or be understood, which relates to the difficulties that his son faced in communicating with others.\n\nThe use of the vocoder on the album is significant because it allows Young to experiment with the sound of his voice and create new textures and melodies. The electronic nature of the album can be seen as a reflection of the increasingly technological world that Young and his fans were living in, and the album's themes of communication and connection reflect the challenges that come with living in a world where communication is more and more mediated by technology.",

         "The reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nA great portion of the expenses in cow-calf production systems is dedicated to the maintenance of healthy cows in productive condition. At the same time, approximately one third of cows removed from the beef herd are eliminated because of reproductive failure (~ 33%, NAHMS 2007–2008). Thus, reproductive inefficiency is a limiting factor for the sustainability of beef cattle production systems that leads to financial losses to cattle producers [1].\nIn cattle, female reproductive failure is assumed when animals do not become pregnant within the breeding season or do not maintain pregnancy to calving [2]. Major female-related causes of reproductive failure include improper health, reproductive and nutritional management, reproductive disorders, and genetics [3,4,5,6]. To mitigate some negative factors that impact reproduction, practices associated with cow herd nutrition, healthcare, and reproductive management have been established.\nThe overall value of a beef female is calculated as the sum of all cash earned over her lifetime minus all expenses. While considerable economic inputs are required to develop replacement heifers, the calves produced throughout a cow’s productive lifespan may repay the costs of development and annual maintenance. The payback period is the period of time required for replacement heifers to pay for their development. This period may vary based upon expenses and cow productivity, but may generally be expected that a female must produce 6 calves to pay for her development and maintenance expenses [7]. If the cow fails to calve just 1 year of her productive lifespan, more than 8 calves are required [7], with no recovery of the lost revenue [8].\nAnother way to consider the profitability of retaining and developing replacement heifers is to calculate net present value (NPV) [7]. Net present value is calculated by accounting for all costs and revenues of the animal over her productive lifespan. Though NPV is heavily influenced by management scheme and calf performance, the reproductive efficiency of a cow greatly influences her NPV. An 11-year-old cow that first calved at age 2 and produced a calf each following year has a higher NPV than a cow that failed to calve 1 year during her productive lifespan [7].\nImportance of first breeding season success in replacement heifers\nHeifer reproductive success in the first calving season is highly linked with lifetime reproductive efficiency [9,10,11]. A compilation of data from multiple studies demonstrated that first breeding season pregnancy rates in beef heifers range from 64 to 95% under natural breeding (NB) alone or the combination of artificial insemination (AI) followed by NB ([12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23] (Fig. 1)). Altogether, an average of 85% of heifers become pregnant by the completion of the breeding season. By comparison, first service conception rates to artificial insemination are lower and range from 36% to 69% [12, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24]. Our recent analysis of breeding records from 7 yrs (2011–2017) indicated that 43%, 42%, and 15% of heifers became pregnant by AI, NB, or failed to become pregnant during their first breeding season, respectively [23].\nUnder current production systems, the most efficient scenario occurs when replacement heifers conceive early in the breeding season. During their first breeding season, ~ 67%, ~ 26%, and ~ 7% of heifers that become pregnant are likely to calve during the initial 21 d, between d 22–42, and after d 42 of the subsequent calving season, respectively [11]. Heifers calving within the first 21 d of their first calving season remain in the productive herd longer and wean more total pounds of calf than their later calving counterparts [11]. In contrast, late breeding heifers contribute to a less efficient cow-calf production system due to reduced days postpartum to resume estrous cyclicity, reduced pregnancy rates in the subsequent calving season, and reductions in calf age and weaning weight [11, 25].\nConsidering the average pregnancy rate (85%) obtained from the data compiled in Fig. 1, and accounting for ~ 5.7 million heifers being developed as replacements in 2020 (data from National Agricultural Statistics Service, January 2020), one can estimate that approximately 3.3 million heifers will conceive in the first 21 d of the breeding season. Approximately 1.6 million heifers will conceive later in the breeding season, and over 800 thousand heifers will not produce a calf by ~ 23–27 months of age. These numbers underscore a critically large number of heifers that receive important farming resources but do not contribute to a long-term, sustainable production system.\nLosses experienced from non-pregnant replacements are the result of opportunity costs of failing to market infertile heifers as feeder calves, wasted nutritional resources, and expenses of breeding and healthcare. If non-pregnant heifers were retained in the herd, such individuals would inevitably represent the negative impacts of a missed calving on NPV and payback period described above. Therefore, non-pregnant replacement heifers are often sold after a failed breeding season.\nThe costs of development, and reduced lifetime potential profitability, however, lead to a negative economic impact for cattle producers. Therefore, extra costs for heifer development due to losses when some heifers fail to become pregnant must be accounted for [26]. Depending on replacement heifer management system, these added costs can equate to ~$43 per replacement heifer developed to the time of pregnancy examination, as estimated by Hughes [26]. Considering the ~ 5.7 million heifers expected to enter replacement development in 2020, such cost might exceed $245 million nationwide. It must be pondered, however, that extra expenses caused by infertility can be reduced if the initial investment in heifer development is not extreme [13].\nThe economic impact of the reduced age of calves from late breeding heifers is also considerably high. Considering market prices of ~$1.65 per pound (USDA, Agriculture Marketing Service; Joplin Regional Stockyards; Feb 17, 2020; average prices of steer and heifer calves of ~ 450 lb.) and an average daily gain of ~ 1.90 lb. per day [27, 28], calves born at the midpoint of the second and third 21 d of the calving season would be worth approximately $131 less than calves born on the first day of the calving season. When this number is multiplied by the 1.6 million heifers expected to conceive late in their first breeding season, one can account for over $210 million lost by beef cattle producers due to late breeding heifers. These numbers underscore reproductive inefficiency among the major limiting biological functions significantly affecting the beef cattle industry.\nThe yearly cost of female infertility varies with the commodity value but remains unacceptably high under the current economic scenario. Since the early 1970s, it has been established that improving pregnancy rates is paramount for the development and maintenance of efficient and sustainable beef cattle production [29]. Since then, there have been major advancements to our understanding of the reproductive physiology of beef heifers and the identification of means to address reproductive inefficiency.\n\nUse the article given to find context in order to answer the question down below on beef heifer fertility. \n\nWhat are the pregnancy rates within heifers that will most likely calve during? Use context from the article to support your answer and create your own example while maintaining a tone similar to the text.",
         "In the first 21 days of the breeding season, the majority of heifers become pregnant. Over 3.3 million heifers will be bred in the first 21 days of the breeding season, which is the majority of heifers that become pregnant. This is compared to 1.6 million heifers that will become pregnant after the first 21 days. These heifers will be calving after 22-42 days of the breeding season. \n\nWhile some heifers are late to calve, there are heifers that have a 7% chance of calving later than 42 days of the breeding season.",

Where in Europe are you interested in visiting?\nDomanic: Well, I really want to see a lot of different places, but some of the top destinations on my list are France, Italy, Spain, and England.\nTravel Agent: That's definitely a lot of ground to cover! Have you given any thought to how long you want to be gone for?\nDomanic: Yeah, I was thinking maybe around three weeks. I know that might not be enough time to see everything I want to see, but it's all I can afford right now.\nTravel Agent: Three weeks is actually a pretty good amount of time for a trip like this. Do you have any specific dates in mind?\nDomanic: Yes, I was hoping to leave sometime in late May or early June. Is that feasible?\nTravel Agent: Let me check...Yes, that looks like it will work out fine. So, you're interested in visiting France, Italy, Spain, and England. Are there any other places you had in mind?\nDomanic: No, those are the four main countries I want to focus on.\nTravel Agent: Okay. What are your thoughts on transportation? Would you prefer to fly into one city and then travel around by train, or would you rather fly into each city separately?\nDomanic: I'm not really sure. What do you think would be the best option?\nTravel Agent: Well, flying into one city and then using trains to get around would probably be the most efficient way to see everything on your list. However, it can be a bit more expensive. Alternatively, you could fly into each city separately, which would give you more flexibility but might not be as cost effective.\nDomanic: Hmm...I'm not sure. Can you give me some prices for both options so I can compare?\nTravel Agent: Sure thing!\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nExtract the information on the prices for the two options:\n1. flying into one city and then using trains to get around.\n2. flying into each city separately.",
         "Sure! Here are the prices for the two options:\n\n1. Flying into one city and then using trains to get around:\n- Round-trip flights from the US to Paris: $700-$1000\n- Eurail Pass (1 month, all countries): $450-$600\n- Additional flights within Europe: $100-$200 each\n- Accommodation (3 weeks): $1000-$1500\nTotal: $1750-$2500\n\n2.

The impact these changes have had on the working world has been profound. The nature of the work we do, the people doing work, the technology we use and our expectations of work look completely different today than from 20 years ago. Taking note that the cycle of change is only accelerating, through a close examination of four societal changes, we can catch a glimpse of what the future of work has in store for us.\nThe nature of our work has changed How?\nOur transition to the knowledge economy is in full swing. A concept first described by Peter Drucker, the knowledge economy details a society where knowledge and information, not material products, are the most valuable economic resource. Knowledge workers leverage education, expertise, and specialized skills to produce new systems of understanding of the world. A report from the Wall Street Journal shows that knowledge work positions have been growing by 1.9 million jobs each year. Routine labor (manual labor or clerical/administrative office work) growth pales in comparison, adding 100-250,000 jobs per year.\nWhy does it matter?\nRoutine labor roles are now endangered professions. The University of Oxford estimates 47% of all U.S. jobs are at risk of computerization in the next 20 years. The roles most at risk are those that do not require specialized education. AI and automation will grow alongside the increasing share of knowledge workers in the labor force, and even come after functions of knowledge work. Consequently, the amount of knowledge transfer that will become part of our jobs will increase. It will become every employee’s responsibility (not just leaders’) to capture, distribute and share knowledge within the organization. Because the marketplace will be changing quickly, knowledge must become editable and flexible so workers can learn new skills that allow them to innovate and problem-solve at pace.\nThe people doing the work have changed\nHow? Our workforce is more diverse by nearly every conceivable metric. Where once middle-aged, white males were the primary drivers of the labor force, we are now driven by a much less homogenous working population. Women, now half of the workforce, are projected to become the majority by 2020. And we have more younger and older workers than ever. The Pew Research Center shows that millennials became the largest generation in the labor force back in 2015 (estimated to be 50% of the global workforce by 2020). At the other end of the spectrum, Americans age 65 and older are projected as the fastest-growing segment of the labor force.\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nWrite a detailed summary of the excerpt, using a listed format that is separated by bullet points. Each bullet point should consist of 3 sentences. Include the specified metrics of how many jobs are at risk of computerization.",

It was developed as a sequel to the original 1986 arcade release of Arkanoid.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe player controls a ship using either a standard controller or the Super NES Mouse. Rounds are completed when all the color and silver blocks on the screen have been eliminated. Enemies enter from the doors at the top of the play area. Every eleven rounds a boss enemy will have to be fought. Some of the blocks contain power-ups that must be caught with the paddle to be used. The game has a total of 99 levels, an edit mode in which users can create their own levels, power-ups, and two-player capabilities.\n\nPlot\nArkanoid: Doh It Again picks up five years after the events in Arkanoid, in which the spacecraft Vaus defeated DOH with its energy ball. In the 9th stardawn, Commander Therle writes a log entry recounting the defeat of DoH and stating that their search for a new home goes on.\n\nOn the 11th stardawn, the sensors of the interstellar ark Arkanoid pick up a stunning new Terra Class Planet and dispatch the Vaus to conduct colonization surveys. Vaus is warped by DoH, who is surrounding the planet and evidently seeking revenge.\n\nAfter the player defeats the boss on round 33, Vaus escapes DoH's realm and returns to the Arkanoid, where it is now the 14th stardawn. The planet was only a hoax created by DoH. The same ending occurs after defeating the boss on round 66, destroying both the planet and the game credits again.\n\nAfter defeating the final boss on round 99, time starts flowing backward. The Vaus escapes for a third time, but it's finally able to land on the planet, on the 13th stardawn. Commander Therle declares that they have found their long-sought home, but will not repeat the mistakes of the past, and humanity and environment would co-exist together. A TV screen appears, as the Commander states that DoH is \"banished into oblivion\". The Commander then ends his final entry and shuts off the TV.\n\nReception \n\nReleased at a time when interest in the Super NES had mostly waned, Arkanoid: Doh it Again was largely ignored by critics. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly all considered it a worthy successor to the original Arkanoid (which they ranked as the 41st best console video game of all time just two months earlier), particularly approving of its large number of single-player levels and enjoyable multiplayer action in both competitive and cooperative forms, though some of them complained at the recycling of bosses. Nintendo Power likewise applauded the multiplayer modes and remarked that \"this is a great game to plug in for some quick fun, but we also found ourselves spending long hours in the Arkanoid world, in both one and two-player modes\".\n\nNotes\n###\n\nFrom the text provided, extract the plot of the game, and use the following format to organize it:\n\nTitle: [Name of the plot section]\nContent: [Description of the plot section]",

The anime had actually ended four years earlier, in a very rare instance of an anime adaptation stopping before the conclusion of the source manga. The final manga arc, Thousand-Year Blood War, is generally considered one of the worst, due to the many plot holes, underdeveloped characters, and loose story threads, especially after the first invasion of Soul Society by the Quincy. Fans are aware that, in 2015, author Tite Kubo was given by publisher Shueisha one year to conclude the manga, but the details of why that happened are still vague, and many theories have cropped up over the years. A common misconception is that Kubo was forced by Shueisha to end the manga due to poor sales, but the truth is actually very different.\n\nIn 2016, Kubo was suffering from poor mental and physical health due to the strain caused by the unforgiving schedule of serializing a manga in Weekly Shonen Jump. It's important to remember that, since the beginning of his career, Kubo had trouble keeping up with the weekly magazine's demands and relating with his editors, but he kept working through all the stress. When 2016 came around, Kubo was suffering from a partially torn tendon in his left shoulder, which he never had the chance to get surgery. As his health kept deteriorating, Kubo finally approached the editors and asked them to end his series in the span of one or two years, and they gave him one. So, while it's true that it was Shueisha's decision to rush the ending of Bleach (two years would have surely let the story pan out better), it was actually Kubo who wanted the manga to end, as he had reached his limit. Luckily, the mangaka took care of his health in the years since, and he is now involved in the production of the Thousand-Year Blood War anime.\n\"\"\"\n\nHow did fans react to the ending of the anime show \"Bleached?\" Briefly explain the final arc of the series.",
         "Bleach is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tite Kubo. The series follows the adventures of the 15-year-old high school student Ichigo Kurosaki, who gains the ability to see ghosts and becomes a \"Soul Reaper\" tasked with guiding souls in the afterlife.\n\nThe final arc of the series, known as \"Thousand-Year Blood War,\" is set in the Soul Society, where the Quincy, a race of beings who can manipulate spiritual energy, launch a massive invasion. The arc is considered by many fans to be one of the worst in the series due to its rushed pacing, underdeveloped characters, and plot holes.\n\nAfter the first invasion of Soul Society by the Quincy, the series went on hiatus for several years due to Kubo's poor health. When the manga returned in 2016, it was revealed that Kubo had been given one year by Shueisha to conclude the manga.\n\nMany fans were disappointed with the rushed ending, as the arc felt incomplete and left many story threads unresolved. However, Kubo later stated that he had always intended for the series to end in one or two years, as he had reached his limit with the weekly serialization demands of Weekly Shonen Jump.\n\nDespite the mixed reception of the final arc, the series remains popular among fans and has inspired various spin-offs, video games, and an anime adaptation. In 2022, an anime adaptation of the \"Thousand-Year Blood War\" arc was announced, much to the delight of longtime fans.",

         "according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nA hill is a piece of land that rises higher than everything surrounding it. It looks like a little bump in the Earth. Since they are higher than everything around them, hills are good places to get a nice view. Hills are easier to climb than mountains. They are less steep and not as high. But, like a mountain, a hill will usually have an obvious summit, which is its highest point. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, there is no official difference between hills and mountains. The United Kingdom and the United States used to define hills as summits less than 1,000 feet. However, both countries abandoned the distinction in the mid-twentieth century. Sometimes, you'll find a hill made by people. This is called a mound. In the Midwest region of North America, a network of Native Americans known as the Hopewell created huge mounds. In fact, the Hopewell people are often called Mound Builders. The most well-known mounds are in Hopewell Culture National Historical Park, in the U.S. state of Ohio. The Hopewell people built mounds in the shape of spirals and domes. These mounds are about 9 meters (30 feet) tall and sometimes as wide as 305 meters (1,000 feet). Archaeologists are unsure what the mounds were used for. Some may have been burial mounds for important people, or they may have been used as astronomical observatories. Natural hills are formed all the time, by different types of geologic activity. One of these activities is faulting, which happens because the rocks underneath the Earth's surface are constantly moving and changing the landscape. Hills formed by faulting can eventually become mountains. The Himalayas in Asia, the tallest mountain range in the world, were once tiny hills. The Himalayas continue to grow because of faulting activity beneath the Earth's surface. Hills are also formed because of erosion, which happens when bits of rock, soil, and sediment get washed away and placed in a pile somewhere else.\nHills can be destroyed by erosion, as the material is worn away by wind and water. Hills can also be created by erosion, as material from other areas is deposited near the hill, causing it to grow. A mountain may become a hill if it is worn down by erosion. Parts of the U.S. state of Indiana are almost entirely flat. However, other parts of the state have a ton of hills. Geologists and geographers have studied the lack of hills in northern Indiana. They discovered that during the Ice Age, glaciers covered the area, mowing down the landscape as they advanced like steamrollers. The glaciers started to melt once they reached the middle of the state. Running water from the melting glaciers helped form the hilly, rugged landscape of southern Indiana. There are a handful of different types of hills. A drumlin is a long hill formed by the movement of glaciers. A butte is a hill that usually stands alone in a flat area. It has steep sides and a flat top. The rest of the hill was eroded away. A tor is a rock formation on top of a hill. Sometimes, especially in the United Kingdom, a tor also refers to the hill itself. A puy is a cone-shaped, volcanic hill. A pingo is a mound of ice covered with earth. These are found in the Arctic and Antarctica. People have used hills for homes and urban areas for thousands of years. Many people have built their homes and villages on hills to avoid floods.\nThe higher elevation also allows people to defend themselves. Ancient Rome, for example, was built on the city's seven hills so Romans could see their invaders coming from far away.\n###\nAre there different types of hills that form on Earth? For your answer, give at least 3 different examples of different hill types and a short description of what they are. Complete this in a short informative essay so that I can turn it in to my high school teacher.",

Employee disputes have the potential to interrupt operations, decrease productivity, and damage employee morale—all of which affect an organization's bottom line.\n\nBusiness leadership and human resource management play key roles in making sure this doesn’t happen. These supervisors are the ones in charge of implementing and enforcing a company’s conflict resolution strategies, as well as mediating workplace disputes when necessary.\nIf you aspire to be a leader in your organization or are already in the process of becoming one, putting out the fires and avoiding conflict between feuding employees will likely fall to you. In fact, a study by the American Management Association (AMA) found that managers spend 24% of their time resolving conflict. It’s no easy task, but with the right tools and education, you’ll be able to handle it head on.\nFollow this guide for eight tips to help you manage employee conflict at work.\n1. Create an Open Door Policy\nTo catch conflict early, managers should create an environment of open communication so employees feel comfortable coming to leadership with their concerns. One way you can facilitate this is by implementing an open-door policy. This policy should encourage employees to come to management about any matter of importance without fear of repercussion. It involves active listening, asking questions, and utilizing teamwork. With this in place, employees will be more likely to reach out when there’s an issue, which can help to prevent conflicts or keep them from escalating further.\n\n2. Determine the Severity of the Situation\nWhen resolving workplace conflict, it’s important to understand the nature and root cause of the conflict. Is it a matter of miscommunication, misinterpreted details, mismatched personalities, or competition among employees? Or is it something more serious like harassment or discrimination? If it’s the latter, that’s an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issue, and your company should already have policies and procedures in place to address it. If not, that should be an immediate priority.\n\nWorkplace conflict can happen for any number of reasons, and honestly conflict is inevitable. It’s important to get to the root of the issue and determine the level of severity so you can decide how best to address it and prevent it from becoming an ongoing problem.\n3. Encourage Employees to Work Out Issues On Their Own\nIt can be tempting to step in whenever there’s office drama to resolve conflict, but there will be instances when it’s best to let employees work out conflicts on their own. After all, the last thing you want is to feel like you’re micromanaging every office squabble. Letting them work together to resolve conflict can help everyone involved.\n\nWhen you see employees engaging in things like friendly disagreements or light political banter, remember to observe and assess. If the disagreements don’t escalate, these situations can be opportunities for employees to find common ground or engage in constructive conversations. Sometimes stepping in too early can cause the situation to escalate because employees may have considered it a nonissue. However, if you think the conflict might escalate or rise to the level of making anyone uncomfortable, it’s time to take action.\n4. Take Action When Necessary\nAs mentioned, some workplace conflict can (and should) be solved between the employees involved. Disputes are bound to happen, but it’s your job to observe and decide whether you should take action.\n\nSo how do you know when it’s time to step in?\nHere are some situations when action is necessary:\nIf friendly banter escalates to bullying\nWhen language becomes explicit, threatening, or aggressive\nIf there are allegations of discrimination or harassment\nWhen conflict disrupts team productivity or threatens team morale\nIf a teasing conversation becomes insulting or disrespectful\nOf course, you should always look into any staff complaints that are brought to your attention. Make sure your employees feel seen and heard, no matter the severity of the situation.\n\n5. Listen to All Parties Involved\nIt’s important to let everyone involved in the conflict present their side of the story without interruption. Your role is to actively listen, remain neutral, and focus on each person’s account. The goal here is for employees to truly listen to one another so they’ll have a deeper understanding of where the opposing side is coming from. Oftentimes, employees will be more inclined to come to a peaceful resolution once they feel acknowledged and heard. You can keep other employees updated on situations when you work to listen carefully as you resolve conflict.\n\n6. Document the Incident\nWhen you’re dealing with workplace conflict, you want to make sure you keep track of all conversations, disciplinary meetings, etc. Be sure to include the facts from any employee-related incident, as well as the resolution each party agreed to. This will help you monitor behavior over time and identify employees who could be toxic to your work environment. It’s also important to record incidents in case any employee should try to take you to court.\n\n7. Get Insight from your Employee Handbook\nAlthough it might seem like common sense, your employee handbook should be the first point of reference when dealing with office conflict. This handbook should serve as a guide to help you navigate disputes and what disciplinary steps to take, if needed. The policies within your handbook need to set clear standards as to what qualifies as unacceptable workplace behavior. They should leave little room for interpretation to ensure there’s zero confusion as to what’s expected.\n\nAs a leader in your organization, it’s critical that your employees are aware of company policies and understand that they’re accountable for their actions and held to the same standards as everyone on the team, regardless of their title or position. Employees should be well aware that if guidelines aren’t met, disciplinary action will be taken.\n\"\"\"\n\nYou are a seasoned HR professional who regularly blogs about the resolution of workplace conflicts.

Once there was so much rubbish on the beach that the tourists stopped coming so he stopped the people coming to the beach, but they all went crazy, saying it was their country and they could come to their own beach, but he didn't want so much rubbish so he made the police go round checking. So I collect rubbish for the people and the tourists. It is better for them because flies come around their picnic when they have finished eating it but they can't be bothered to go the bins because it is far.'\n\n'So you have a good business. I have a business too. I sell seashells.'\n\n'Does that make money?'\n\n'Yes good money. Today I bought a burger. Here have a ten coin. Buy yourself a cheese roll.'\n\n'Sister you are good to me. A man can't work on an empty stomach. So where are you from?'\n\n'I lived with my grandmother in the city but she died. Before that I lived with my parents but I don't remember where.'\n\n'That bad?'\n\n'What do you mean?'\n\n'Something bad must have happened to you for you to forget. Probably it was because of an Indigo man.'\n\n'What's an Indigo man?'\n\n'He's a man, he pretends to be nice but he is a kind of devil. My mother had a farm but their crops died and they couldn't pay the rent. She owed everybody money and could have gone to prison but she dealt with an Indigo man, he pays your debts but you have to promise to work for him for the rest of your life, or at least twenty years. My mother went to a sewing factory; I wasn't allowed to go with her. The Indigo man tied me up and put me in a truck that took me two hundred miles away to a farm where I was supposed to work. The man who owned the farm was mean and didn't give me anything to eat and put me to sleep in a barn full of rats so I ran away, hid on the back of a truck, then I sneaked on the train to come here to tell my great grandfather. My father sometimes works here on the coast shipping coffee, but he has many wives and children and doesn't care about me. My great grandfather is rich, but he is out of touch with us. I heard all about him in stories from my father. He has a boat yard but he is always away. He has money, he could help my mum.\n\nYour task is to:\nWhich of the following emotional categories best describe the text?\n- Happy\n- Sad\n- Angry\n- Compassionate\n- Other (please specify)",

We will remember being quarantined, masked, and restricted due to the global pandemic of COVID-19. We will remember the 500-year flood which devasted our neighborhoods. Above all, we will remember uniting our efforts in order to help rise above the challenges of this year. Yes, we will remember the helpers. Some of those helpers can be named individually. Others are the organizations which generously stepped up to do what needed to be done to help take care of our community, like Dow.\n\nUnited Way of Clare and Gladwin Counties extends heartful appreciation to Dow for providing numerous volunteers and philanthropic support to aid in the flood relief efforts for Gladwin County. \"Dow employees rolled up their sleeves and helped staff our resource center where residents impacted by the flood were able to go for critical supplies. The funds provided by Dow will be dispersed through our partner, the Mid Michigan Community Action Agency (MMCAA), to meet the needs of Gladwin County residents who were impacted by the recent flooding of 2020,' says United Way Executive Director, Sarah Block.\n\n\"As the liaison for Dow's Gladwin County flood relief efforts and also as an active United Way board member, I have seen firsthand the great things the power of being united can bring,\" says Jane Zdrojewski. \"Dow not only donated to the relief efforts, they also supported emergency efforts in many other ways in the days/weeks/months following the flood. Dow continues to show their community support across our county as well as other areas impacted by the flood. I am so proud to work for a company that puts their money where their heart is.\"\n\nGladwin County residents who were impacted by the flood in any way should register with FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency). These United Way funds will be dispersed through MMCAA to those who may still require financial aid after FEMA has distributed their share of support to each qualifying resident. \"United Way is proud to serve the residents of our counties alongside Dow and MMCAA during these challenging times,\" adds Block. For financial inquiries, contact MMCAA at 989-426-2801.\n\n\"This is another great example of how the United Way of Clare and Gladwin County can ensure the donations we receive are given directly back to the community we live in,\" says United Way Board President, Lacey Cameron. \"The long-term recovery process has so many aspects to it…there's the need to repair homes and neighborhoods, but also the emotional and mental health needs of some of those impacted by the flood waters. These dollars will go directly to flood victims in Gladwin County to help them begin to recover.\"\n\nTo learn more about how to give or get help through your local United Way, please visit UnitedWayCGC.org, or the United Way of Clare and Gladwin Counties Facebook page, or call 989-386-6015.\n\nYour task is to:\nFrom the text given, extract details about the ways in which Dow helped in the flood relief efforts.
